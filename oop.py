In Python, an instance refers to an individual occurrence or occurrence of a class. When you create an object from a class, that object is called an instance of the class. The class serves as a blueprint, and instances are actual objects created based on that blueprint. Each instance has its own unique state and behavior.

Here's an example to illustrate instances in Python:
# Define a simple class named "Person"
class Person:
    # The __init__ method is a constructor that initializes the instance variables
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # A method to display information about the person
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

# Create instances of the class "Person"
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

# Call the method to display information for each person
person1.display_info()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
person2.display_info()  # Output: Name: Bob, Age: 25

Creating an object is necessary when a built-in data type is not appropriate.
Correct

A class can be created when the built-in data types cannot be used.
